Project 1

Project Overview:
This project is a responsive web application developed using React. It fetches and displays real-time data from two endpoints provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), specifically related to manufacturing processes.
Project Structure:
	•	App.js: Contains the main component of the application.
	•	axios: Utilized for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the NIST endpoints.
Features:
•	Real-time Data Update: The application automatically refreshes the displayed data every second.
	•	Current Data Display: Shownpmhe current manufacturing data obtained from the NIST API.
	•	Sample Data Display: Presents the sample manufacturing data retrieved from the NIST API.
	•	Error Handling: Logs errors to the console if there's any issue fetching data from the API.
Dependencies:
	•	React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
	•	axios: A promise-based HTTP client for browser and node.js.
	•	useState: React hook for managing state in functional components.
	•	useEffect: React hook for performing side effects in functional components.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
		Install dependencies using npm install.
		Run the application using npm start.
		Open the application in a web browser.
Additional Notes:
	•	The application continuously retrieves data from the NIST API every second using setInterval.
	•	Fetched data is displayed in separate sections for current and sample data.
	•	Error handling is implemented to capture and log any errors occurring during data retrieval
2. Despite the absence of live delivery, the presentation slides effectively conveyed the significance and potential impact of biometric authentication-based intrusion detection using AI and IoT technology. The slides were well-structured, visually appealing, and provided clear explanations of key concepts, making the content accessible and engaging for the audience. The presenter demonstrated a deep understanding of the subject matter and effectively highlighted the advantages of the proposed solution. Moving forward, incorporating real-world examples or case studies could further bolster the presentation's credibility and demonstrate the practical application of the technology. Overall, the presenter did an excellent job of presenting a complex topic in a concise and comprehensible manner.
